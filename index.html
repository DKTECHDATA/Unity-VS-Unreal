        <section class="detailed-comparison">
            <h2>Detailed Comparison</h2>
            <h3>1. Pricing</h3>
            <p><strong>Unity:</strong> Unity offers a subscription model (Unity Pro) with no royalties, which means developers can budget their costs effectively without worrying about additional fees based on their game's success. This is particularly advantageous for small teams and independent developers who may have limited financial resources. The absence of royalties allows developers to retain more of their revenue, making Unity a financially attractive option.</p>
            <p><strong>Unreal Engine:</strong> While Unreal Engine is free to use initially, it imposes a 5% royalty on gross revenue after the first $1 million per product. This can lead to significant costs for successful projects, making financial planning more complex. For developers who anticipate high sales, this royalty model can become a burden, making Unity a more predictable and cost-effective choice.</p>

            <h3>2. Ease of Use</h3>
            <p><strong>Unity:</strong> Unity is renowned for its user-friendly interface and intuitive design. The learning curve is gentle, making it accessible for beginners and smaller teams. The drag-and-drop functionality and visual scripting options allow developers to create games without extensive programming knowledge. This ease of use accelerates the development process, enabling teams to focus on creativity rather than technical hurdles.</p>
            <p><strong>Unreal Engine:</strong> Unreal Engine, while powerful, has a steeper learning curve, especially for those unfamiliar with C++. The complexity of its interface and tools can be daunting for newcomers. This can lead to longer onboarding times and may discourage less experienced developers from fully utilizing its capabilities.</p>

            <h3>3. Graphics and Visual Quality</h3>
            <p><strong>Unity:</strong> Unity provides a flexible graphics engine that supports a variety of visual styles, including 2D and mobile graphics. Developers can achieve high-quality visuals without the need for extensive resources or expertise. The ability to customize graphics settings allows for optimization across different platforms, making it easier to create visually appealing games that run smoothly on a range of devices.</p>
            <p><strong>Unreal Engine:</strong> Unreal Engine is known for its stunning graphics and high-fidelity visuals, which are ideal for AAA games. However, achieving similar results in Unity can be more straightforward and less resource-intensive. Unity's flexibility in visual styles allows developers to experiment and find the best fit for their projects without being constrained by high-end hardware requirements.</p>

            <h3>4. Performance</h3>
            <p><strong>Unity:</strong> Unity generally performs well across a wide range of platforms, particularly for mobile games. Its architecture is optimized for performance, allowing developers to create games that run efficiently on various devices. The ability to fine-tune performance settings ensures that games can be optimized for different hardware specifications, making Unity a versatile choice for developers targeting multiple platforms.</p>
            <p><strong>Unreal Engine:</strong> While Unreal Engine excels in high-end graphics, it often requires more powerful hardware for optimal performance. This can limit the accessibility of games developed with Unreal, particularly for mobile and lower-end devices. Unity's performance optimization capabilities make it a more adaptable choice for developers looking to reach a broader audience.</p>

            <h3>5. Asset Store and Marketplace</h3>
            <p><strong>Unity:</strong> Unity features a vast and diverse Asset Store, providing a wide range of assets, tools, and plugins that facilitate easier and faster development. Developers can find pre-made assets, scripts, and tools that can significantly reduce development time and costs. The extensive selection allows for greater creativity and customization, enabling developers to enhance their projects without extensive custom development.</p>
            <p><strong>Unreal Engine:</strong> Unreal Engine has a Marketplace, but the selection may not be as extensive or varied as Unity's Asset Store. This can limit developers' options when looking for specific assets or tools, potentially slowing down the development process.</p>

            <h3>6. Community and Support</h3>
            <p><strong>Unity:</strong> Unity boasts a large and active community, with extensive documentation, tutorials, and forums that provide robust support for developers at all levels. The wealth of resources available makes it easier for developers to find solutions to their problems and learn new skills. This strong community support fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing, enhancing the overall development experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Unreal Engine:</strong> While Unreal Engine has a strong community, it may not offer the same breadth of beginner-friendly resources as Unity. New developers may find it more challenging to access the information they need to get started, which can hinder their progress.</p>

            <h3>7. Cross-Platform Development</h3>
            <p><strong>Unity:</strong> Unity excels in cross-platform support, allowing developers to easily deploy games on various platforms, including mobile, desktop, and consoles. The streamlined process for deploying games across multiple devices simplifies the development workflow and enables developers to reach a wider audience without extensive rework.</p>
            <p><strong>Unreal Engine:</strong> While Unreal Engine supports cross-platform development, it may require more configuration and setup, making Unity a more straightforward choice for developers looking to publish on multiple platforms.</p>

            <h3>8. 2D Game Development</h3>
            <p><strong>Unity:</strong> Unity offers robust tools and features specifically designed for 2D game development, making it the preferred choice for developers focusing on 2D projects. The dedicated 2D tools streamline the development process, allowing for greater efficiency and creativity in creating 2D games.</p>
            <p><strong>Unreal Engine:</strong> Unreal Engine primarily focuses on 3D game development, and while it can support 2D, it is not as efficient or user-friendly for 2D projects as Unity. Developers looking to create 2D games may find Unity's tools more suitable for their needs.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Unity is a better choice for customers due to its cost-effectiveness, ease of use, flexibility in graphics and performance, extensive asset resources, strong community support, and robust cross-platform capabilities. These advantages make Unity an ideal option for developers, particularly those working on smaller projects, indie games, or who are new to game development. The combination of these factors positions Unity as a more accessible and versatile game development platform compared to Unreal Engine.</p>

            <h2>Key Differences</h2>
            <p><strong>Multiplatform Support:</strong> Unity excels in multiplatform support, allowing developers to create a game once and deploy it across more than 25 platforms, including consoles, mobile devices, and PCs. This flexibility is a significant advantage for developers looking to reach a broader audience.</p>
            <p><strong>WebGL Support:</strong> Unity provides robust support for WebGL, enabling developers to create interactive web applications and games that run directly in web browsers without the need for plugins. This capability is essential for reaching users on various devices through the web.</p>
